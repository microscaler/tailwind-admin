# Tailwind Admin

This repository contains a multi-framework admin dashboard built with **Tailwind CSS**, initially based on the **TailAdmin React Pro** template. It is being incrementally ported to **SolidJS** and **Leptos (Rust/WebAssembly)**.

All implementations share a design goal: high-quality UI, clean architecture, full test coverage, and parity in functionality and appearance across stacks.

## ðŸ§­ Project Structure

```text
.
â”œâ”€â”€ react/     # React 19 + Tailwind CSS (baseline reference implementation)
â”œâ”€â”€ solidjs/   # SolidJS port (JSX + fine-grained reactivity)
â”œâ”€â”€ leptos/    # Leptos (Rust + WASM full-stack prototype)
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/   # GitHub Actions workflows (CI/CD)
â””â”€â”€ shared/    # (Planned) Shared assets, test fixtures, or schemas
```

---

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Each framework runs independently with its own dependencies and build system.

### React

```bash
cd react
npm install
npm run dev      # Starts Vite on http://localhost:3000
```

### SolidJS

```bash
cd solidjs
npm install
npm run dev      # Starts Vite on http://localhost:4000
```

### Leptos

```bash
cd leptos
cargo install cargo-leptos
cargo leptos serve       # Serves app at http://localhost:3000
```

## ðŸ“¦ Common Scripts

These scripts are defined per framework in each `package.json`.

| Script                | Description                                |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `npm run dev`         | Starts local dev server                    |
| `npm run build`       | Builds production assets                   |
| `npm run start`       | Serves production build                    |
| `npm run lint`        | Runs ESLint                                |
| `npm run typecheck`   | Runs TypeScript compiler with `--noEmit`   |
| `npm run test:unit`   | Runs Vitest unit tests                     |
| `npm run test:mutation` | Runs Stryker mutation tests              |
| `npm run test:e2e`    | Runs Playwright tests                      |
| `npm run test:e2e:update` | Updates visual snapshot baselines     |
| `npm run test:e2e:report` | Opens Playwright HTML report           |

> ðŸ§  Leptos uses `cargo leptos build` and `cargo leptos serve` instead of npm scripts for build/start.

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Visual Snapshots

Each implementation uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for:

- Functional end-to-end tests (e.g. login, navigation)
- Visual regression testing with `toMatchSnapshot()` (baseline screenshots)
- CI enforcement for UI drift detection

Snapshots are stored under each frameworkâ€™s `tests/__screenshots__/` folder.  
To update them after a legitimate UI change:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:update
```

---

## ðŸ§° Continuous Integration (CI)

Pull requests to `main` trigger three GitHub Actions workflows:

| Workflow     | Runs On           | Purpose                                             |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **React CI** | `react/` directory | Lint, typecheck, unit + mutation tests, E2E, perf   |
| **Solid CI** | `solidjs/`         | Matches React CI with SolidJS source                |
| **Leptos CI**| `leptos/`          | Rust fmt, clippy, unit tests, E2E (via WASM), perf  |

**Branch protection is enabled for `main`. All CI checks must pass before merging.**

Each workflow includes:
- ðŸ§¹ Lint/type checks
- ðŸ§ª Unit + mutation tests
- ðŸŽ­ Playwright E2E + visual regression
- âš¡ Lighthouse performance audits (TBT, FCP, JS bundle size)

Artifacts (e.g. screenshots, logs, HTML reports) are uploaded for CI review.

## ðŸ§  Goals & Design Principles

- âœ… Match behavior and appearance across frameworks (React = baseline)
- âœ… Full automation: E2E, mutation testing, CI pipelines
- âœ… Support AI-assisted contributions via well-scoped tasks
- âœ… Build a testbed for SolidJS and Leptos in production-style projects
- âœ… Encourage design fidelity with the original TailAdmin Figma (when available)
